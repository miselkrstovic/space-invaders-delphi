# Space Invaders for Delphi

A Delphi implementation of the classical arcade game [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders). Was ~~implemented~~ hacked in a 3 &#189; hours long hackathon, back in 2011. Then spent a week cleaning it up for better presentation.

### Prerequisites

This game utilizes modules from [Graphics32](https://github.com/graphics32/graphics32), therefore you must have it installed into your Delphi development environment before attempting to run the game.

Also needed are the ubiquitous two projects  [JCL](https://github.com/project-jedi/jcl) and [JVCL](https://github.com/project-jedi/jvcl).
