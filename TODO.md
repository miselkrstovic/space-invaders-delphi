# TODO

##### Core
* Two player mode

##### Sound effects
* Alien's movement sfx
* Mystery ship's cruising sound is continuous, event after it goes off focus
* Alien's movement sfx should speed up upon alien being hit

##### Animation effects
* Left to right screen wiping of aliens mesh
* Slow initial drawing of aliens (one by one)
* Step by step movement of aliens

##### Miscellaneous
* Score is being reseted at new wave
* Alien missiles are three different types with distinct graphics
* Show "Game Over" string on death of laser cannon at top center of screen in capital
  (HINT: OnStopGame intro screen)
* When a player shoots an alien, the alien's horizontal speed increases
* Bunker random mutation debris with radius of 1px around MISSILE_RECT

* AI regarding alien missile is wrong

##### Futuristic
* Convert to SDL based app

##### Refactoring
* Refactor ALIEN iterator into a one dimensional array
* Create an interface for Orchestratable objects
* Create an interface for Drawable objects
